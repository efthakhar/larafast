Larafast is a flexible system based on laravel which provide you handy reuseable features to build real life project and
develop your project features in plugable and modular way.



Larafast Structure :
====================
=> You will find larafast folder in your laravel root directory
=> "Larafast\Core\ServiceProvider" included in providers array of app.php config file
=> "Larafast\\" namespace included in composer.json file of root laravel directory

Our larafast system is separated from the core laravel framework by these 3 section.
No need to mess with core framework, do everything in larafast/Plugins directory only :)



Larafast Working System :
=========================

=> On activate any plugin, service provider of that plugin will be registered
=> On deactivate the plugin, service provider of that plugin will be removed from registration
=> On delete the plugin, plugin directory will be deleted


    ==> Plugin Development Guideline:
    ---------------------------------
    => Plugin's directory name must be unique and Capitalized
    => Plugin's information will be stored as key value pair in plugin root directory's plugin-info.php file
    => Plugin's ServiceProvider will be in this format: Larafast/Plugins/PluginName/PluginServiceProvider
